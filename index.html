                <h2 id="About">About</h2>
                <p>Tyler, The Creator is a Grammy-winning alternative hip-hop and jazz-rap musical artist. His earliest beginnings in music date back to 2007 when the rap group called Odd Future formed. From there, he dropped his first solo studio album in 2011. He has dropped an album every two years since then with his most recent album called Call Me If You Get Lost in 2021. He also owns a clothing brand called Golf Wang and another line called Golf Le Fluer. He is known for his silly and crude humor and his music that continues to push boundaries.</p>
                <p>Tyler, The Creator has been my favorite artist since 2018. As soon as I discovered his album Flowerboy, I was immediately hooked. I listened to every single song on every single one of his albums over and over again. His albums are all so different from each other that it is hard for me to pick a favorite. If I had to pick, I would say Igor. But if you asked me on a different day, I might say Cherry Bomb. I finally saw him live last March during his Call Me If You Get Lost Tour. My mom and I got pit tickets and had a blast. It was unreal. I am anxiously awaiting the release of his next album.</p>

                <p>Tyler, The Creator's clothing brand is called Golf Wang and sells streetwear clothing, shoes, bags, posters and other items. He has also collaborated with Converse and periodically releases new designs. He also has another clothing line called Golf Le Fleur. I probably own about 15 items of merchandise from his clothing brand. My favorite piece of clothing that I have from his brand is a tan hoodie that says "Save the bees" in reference to his Flowerboy album. I also have multiple posters in my room and a drawing that I made of him. Clearly, he is my favorite artist!</p>
